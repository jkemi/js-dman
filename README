DMan is a Javascript dependency manager.
Should be compatible with all modern browsers (and probably ie6 as well)

DMan is built in two configurations
 release/dman-min.js minimized release build (1.3 kb, 0.6 kb gzip)
 debug/dman-dbg.js full debug build (use for development)

 dman can be catenated into existing .js-files to reduce network requests.

Build instructions (with GNU make):
 make -f Makefile
